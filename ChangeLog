	* gphotofs.c: Lots of stuff.
	- (struct OpenFile) (freeOpenFile) (gphotofs_open)
	  (gphotofs_release). Add a count for open files so
	  that they aren't closed too early.
	- (gpresultToErrno). Map libgphoto2 errors to errnos,
	  or at least try to. Prevents things going off the
	  deepend if there is an error.
        - (gphotofs_getattr). Don't go into an infinite loop
          if called for a non-existent file.
        - (gphotofs_readdir). Set the block count for files.
          This allows du to report a meaningful result.
